Nestled in the lap of the Garhwal Himalayas, the Roopkund Trek is a
captivating journey that combines natural splendor, historical intrigue,
and the thrill of adventure. Known as the “Mystery Lake Trek,” this
trail leads trekkers to the enigmatic Roopkund Lake, renowned for its
skeletal remains that rest at the lake's edge. Embarking on this trek is
not just about reaching a destination; it's about embracing the journey,
unraveling history, and experiencing the raw beauty of the mountains.

## The Allure of Roopkund

At an altitude of approximately 16,500 feet, Roopkund Lake lies amidst
snow-capped peaks and rocky terrains. The skeletal remains, dating back
to the 9th century, are believed to belong to a group of travelers
caught in a devastating hailstorm. This haunting yet fascinating mystery
adds a layer of intrigue to the trek, drawing adventurers and history
enthusiasts alike.

## Getting Started

The trek usually begins from Lohajung, a quaint village that serves as
the base camp. Lohajung itself offers breathtaking views and sets the
tone for the journey ahead. The trek spans around 8-9 days, covering a
distance of roughly 53 kilometers. It is classified as a moderate to
challenging trek, making it suitable for those with prior trekking
experience or a good fitness level.

## Trail Highlights

1.  **Lohajung to Didna Village:** The first leg of the journey takes
    you through dense forests of oak and rhododendron. Didna Village,
    with its terraced fields and traditional houses, provides a glimpse
    into the local culture.
2.  **Ali and Bedni Bugyal:** These alpine meadows are the crown jewels
    of the trek. Expansive and lush, they offer panoramic views of the
    Trishul and Nanda Ghunti peaks. Camping here under a starlit sky is
    an experience like no other.
3.  **Pathar Nachauni and Bhagwabasa:** As you ascend, the terrain
    becomes rugged, and the air thinner. Pathar Nachauni and Bhagwabasa
    are critical acclimatization stops, preparing trekkers for the final
    push to Roopkund.
4.  **Roopkund Lake:** The culmination of the trek is both thrilling and
    humbling. Surrounded by towering peaks and the eerie skeletons, the
    lake exudes an otherworldly charm. The sense of accomplishment upon
    reaching this point is unparalleled.

## Best Time to Visit

The ideal time for the Roopkund Trek is during the pre-monsoon months of
May and June or the post-monsoon period in September and October. During
these times, the weather is favourable, and the trails are accessible,
